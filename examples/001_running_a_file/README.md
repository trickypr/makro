# Running a file

This example will show you how to run a `.mpy` file using `makros`. It will not take advantage of any macros.

Make sure you have `makros` installed on your computer. On most computers, you can install it by running:

```bash
pip install makros
```

This can then be used to run the hello program:

```bash
makros hello.mpy
```

This will generate a file called `hello.py` with all of the comments stripped out of it. This file will be run by the `makros` command automatically, but it can be helpful for debugging and understanding the code that a specific macro may generate.
